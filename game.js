// 1. Create a constant variable called answer that is assigned to a number of your choosing

// BONUS: Instead of 1, generate a random number between 1 and 100

// Get the user's guess

// Convert the guess to a number
// All prompt() returns text (or string) which is not the same type as number so ("10" === 10 is false) aka ("10" is not equal to 10) or ("10 " !== 10 is true)

// Keep looping until the guess is correct
// While the guess is not the same as the answer

  // Check if the guess is too high or too low and prompt new guess

  // Convert the guess to a number

// If the loop has exited, the guess must be correct

// Generate a random number between 1 and 100
// Get a reference to the form and the message element (use document.querySelector)

// BONUS: Reference the previous element

// Add a submit event listener to the form
  // Prevent the form from being submitted

  // Get the user's guess

  // BONUS: Create a list item element that will go into a list so user can see previous choices. Call it previousGuessEntry

  // Check if the guess is too high, too low, or correct ("Try lower", "Try higher", "You got it!")
  // Change the message.textContent to the appropriate message
  // BONUS: Change the previousGuessEntry.textContent to give information about guess

  // Append previousGuessEntry to previous to add the list item under the unordered list

// Additional practice
// Use functions to introduce rounds
// Have "lives" and display them on the webpage
// When you win, change the background to green and when you lose, change the background to red
